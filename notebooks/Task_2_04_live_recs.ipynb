    "## How the Recommendation System Handles Rare Baskets\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation system works in three steps to make sure it can always suggest items, even if the basket is unusual or new.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Exact Matches\n",
    "First, the system looks for rules that exactly match the items in the basket.  \n",
    "For example, if a basket has `pasta` and `olive oil` and there’s a rule that says people who buy these also buy `canned tomatoes`, that recommendation is used.  \n",
    "This is the most precise way to suggest items because it’s based on real patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Partial Matches\n",
    "If no exact rules match, the system looks for partial matches.  \n",
    "It checks which rules have some items in common with the basket, and gives a score based on how many items overlap and how strong the rule is.  \n",
    "This way, even if your basket isn’t exactly like the patterns in the dataset, the system can still make reasonable guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Popular Items Fallback\n",
    "Finally, if neither exact nor partial matches produce anything, the system falls back on frequency.  \n",
    "It looks at the dataset to see which items often appear with anything in the basket, and suggests the most common ones.  \n",
    "This ensures you always get recommendations, even for very unusual combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This three-step approach makes the system flexible and reliable, so it can handle both common and rare shopping baskets.\n"
