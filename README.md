Project Summary: Smart Grocery Logic
I broke this project into three stages, moving from basic data sorting to a more complex system that can "see" and "predict" what a shopper needs.

1. Organizing the Basics
I started by building a simple Python tool that mimics how the Apple Reminders app automatically sorts groceries. If you type in "limes," it knows to put them under "Fruit & Veg." The goal here wasn't to build a massive model, but to figure out how to structure the data and set clear category boundaries so the system is reliable from the start.

2. Building a Recommendation Engine
Once I had the categories working, I wanted to see if the system could suggest what’s missing from a basket. If someone adds pasta and olive oil, the model suggests canned tomatoes. This stage taught me that the "smart" features are only as good as the organization beneath them; the work I did in the first task is what actually made these suggestions possible.

3. Visual Identification
For the final step, I moved from text to images. I trained a neural network on photos of apples, bananas, carrots, and tomatoes to see whether it could identify a product just by looking at it. I wasn't just looking for perfect accuracy. Here, I was interested in where the system gets confused. Seeing where a model struggles to distinguish between similar-looking items helps show the limits of relying solely on visual data.
